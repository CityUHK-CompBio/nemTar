# 1  Introduction

Cancers are not single disease entities, but comprising multiple molecularly
distinct subtypes, and the heterogeneity prevents precise selection of patients
for optimized therapy. Dissecting cancer subtype-specific signaling pathways is
crucial to pinpointing dysregulated genes for the prioritization of novel
therapeutic targets.
Nested effects models (NEMs) are a group of graphical models that encode subset
relations between observed downstream effects under perturbations to upstream
signaling genes, providing a prototype for mapping the inner workings of the
cell. In this study, we developed NEM-Tar, which extends the original NEMs to
predict drug targets by incorporating causal information of (epi)genetic
aberrations for signaling pathway inference. An information theory-based score,
weighted information gain (WIG), was proposed to assess the impact of signaling
genes on a specific downstream biological process.
We will show in detail how to implement a toy example for singaling network
inference as well as a real case study for prioritizing the potential
therapeutic targets.

Figure 1. Comparison between the structures of (A) classic NEM and (B) our proposed NEM-Tar

As shown in Figure 1A, in classic nested effects models, the S-genes are modeled
as hidden variables, and their signaling interaction graph G (solid arrows) is
the target to infer. In experiments with perturbations to individual S-genes,
differential expression of downstream genes could be observed and considered as
effect reporter genes (E-genes). Assuming that each E-gene is directly regulated
by at most one S-gene in G, the maximum a posteriori attachment Î˜ (dashed
arrows) of effect genes to S-genes could be computed. The goal is to search for
the signaling graph G, which yields the most likely probabilistic nested
effects.
Illustrated in Figure 1B, an extra observational dimension (the real patients)
is the factor that NEM-Tar should deal with.The necessary adjustment should be
conducted on the design and inference strategies of classic NEM. However, the
information needs to infer is also the hidden interaction between S-genes and
the attachment relationship of E-genes to S-genes.And the likelihood function of
NEM-Tar is similar to that of NEMs, except the state matrix of regulators
(S-genes) S* in our model.

# 3  Network inference on a toy example

## 3.1  Introduction of the in-silico data

The applicaitons on real case studies of NEM-Tar require a lot of data
preprocssing and integrative selection of singaling genes(S-genes) and effect
reporter genes(E-genes).For the purpose of interpreting the main work flow and
contribution of NEM-Tar.At first, we will introduce the employed in-silico data.

```{r}
library(nemTar)
library(dplyr)
data("example")
```

The toy example contains four different elements.The S-gene number was applied
in medium size(12), thus the dimension of Sgene_hidden, storing the unobserved
S-gene states was 12\times12; Edata is the E-gene profiles with the dimension
804\times100, S_obs is the observed profile of S-gene states 'after'
perturbations,with the dimension of 100\times12.

```{r}
dim(Edata)
dim(S_obs)
dim(Sgene_hidden)
para
```

## 3.2  Network Inference Using Greedy hill-climbing
```{r}
control<-nem::set.default.parameters(Sgenes=rownames(Sgene_hidden),type="mLL",para=para)
nemTar_rslt<-nem_Tar_greedy(Edata,Sgenes=control$Sgenes,S_obs,control=control)
```
This process takes a few seconds.

## 3.3  Visulization of the inferred S-gene network

To visualize the inference results, an R package RedeR is suggested.However, the
function plot.nem could give a more quickly visulization.The error matrix is the
difference between the inferred S-gene matrix and the generated S-gene matrix,
the result that all the entries is 0 indicates that the inference is perfect.
```{r}
plot.nem(nemTar_rslt,what="graph")
plot.nem(nemTar_rslt,what="graph",transitiveReduction=T)
adj<-as(nemTar_rslt$graph, "matrix")
error<-Sgene_hidden-adj
print(error)
```

# 4  Case study I-Inferring the Signaling Network Driving the EMT Subtype of Gastric Cancer and Prioritization of Potential Drug Targets

## 4.1  Introduction of the input profiles of GC

The profiles of GC contains three different elements.The S-gene number was
determined as 14, thus the dimension of adjacency matrix of S-gene interacction
network was 14\times14; Edata_GC_ori and D are the E-gene profiles before and after 
the transformation to binary variable,with the dimension of 1194\times40 and 818\times27,
respectively; Sdata_GC is the observed profile of 'natural' perturbation states of
Sgenes with the dimension of 27\times14.

```{r}
# load the input profiles of GC
library(nemTar)
data("case_GC")
data("EMT_list")
```

## 4.2  Transforming the E-gene profiles into binary variable and network inference
```{r}
res.disc <- nem.discretize(Edata_GC_ori,neg.control=1:10,pos.control=11:13,nfold=2,cutoff= 0.5)
D<-res.disc$dat
para<-res.disc$para
control<-set.default.parameters(Sgenes=Sgenes_GC,type="mLL",para=para)
nemTar_GC<-nem_Tar_greedy(D=D,Sgenes=Sgenes_GC,S_pattern=Sdata_GC,control=control)
```

## 4.3  Visulization of the inferred S-gene network

### 4.3.1  Quick visulization
```{r}
plot.nem(nemTar_GC,what="graph")
plot.nem(nemTar_GC,what="graph",transitiveReduction=T)
```

### 4.3.2  Employing the 'RedeR' package to visualize the network(after adjustment of the layout,color etc.)

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("E:/Thesis/NEM_tar_Fig/RedeR_show.png")
```

## 4.4  Assessment of the influence of S-gene perturbations on EMT process
The statistical significance of the causal effect that the S-genes exert on
downstream pathways(EMT pathway here) is quantified by permutation tests,
i.e.,random sampling of E-genes with the same number of EMT signature genes in
the regulon of a S-gene, and calculating the frequency of observing a same or
higher WIG from the sampled E-gene sequences.(The value 0 of the adjusted P
stands for the corresponding P value is less than the resolution of current
sampling times,in the following case P<1e-05.)

```{r}
EMT_post<-path_post(nemTar_GC,EMT_list,Sgenes_GC)
WIG<-compute_WIG(EMT_post$post_affected,EMT_post$path_affected,14)
sample_WIG0<-WIG_sample(EMT_post,nemTar_GC,EMT_list,14,1e05)
sig_test<-WIGsig_test(sample_WIG0,WIG,1e05)
### results summary
sig_rslt<-data.frame(S_genes=names(EMT_post$Sig_affected)[which(lengths(EMT_post$path_affected)!=0)],
                     WIG=round(WIG$WIG,2),adjusted_P=format(round(sig_test,6),
                                                            scientific = TRUE,digits = 3))
colnames(sig_rslt)<-c("S genes","WIG","Adjusted P")
sig_rslt<-sig_rslt[order(sig_rslt$WIG,decreasing=TRUE),]
knitr::kable(sig_rslt,align="l",row.names=F,caption="Assessment of single S-gene perturbation  
             on EMT in GC")
```

Also, the weigheted information gain(WIG) of combinational perturbation of 2
S-genes could be calcualted.The kinases of double perturbation with higher WIGs
could be the candidate combinational therapeutic targets.
```{r}
Sgene_double_WIG<-WIG_double(EMT_post,14)
### results summary
sig_rslt<-data.frame(S_genes=names(Sgene_double_WIG$WIG),
                     WIG=round(Sgene_double_WIG$WIG,2))
colnames(sig_rslt)<-c("S genes","WIG")
sig_rslt<-sig_rslt[order(sig_rslt$WIG,decreasing=TRUE),]
knitr::kable(sig_rslt[match(c("CDH1/ERBB2","KRAS/CDH1","BRAF/CDH1","BRAF/ERBB2",
                              "KRAS/ERBB2","KRAS/BRAF"),rownames(sig_rslt)),],
             align="l",row.names=F,caption="Assessment of double perturbations 
             (kinase only) on EMT in GC")
```

## 5.1  Introduction of the input profiles of CRC

The profiles of GC contains three different elements.The S-gene number was
prioritized as 15, thus the dimension of adjacency matrix of S-gene interacction
network was 15\times15; Edata_GC_ori and D are the E-gene profiles before and
after the transformation to binary variable,with the dimension of 1337\times93
and 1292\times54,respectively; Sdata_CRC is the observed profile of 'natural'
perturbation states of S-genes with the dimension 54\times15.

```{r}
library(nemTar)
data("case_CRC")
data("EMT_list")
```


## 5.2  Transforming the E-gene profiles into binary variable and network inference
```{r}
res.disc <- nem.discretize(Edata_CRC_ori,neg.control=1:27,pos.control=28:39,nfold=2,cutoff= 0.6)
D<-res.disc$dat
para<-res.disc$para
control<-set.default.parameters(Sgenes=Sgenes_CRC,type="mLL",para=para)
nemTar_CRC<-nem_Tar_greedy(D,Sgenes=control$Sgenes,Sdata_CRC,control=control)
```

Similar to study in GC, the weigheted information gain(WIG) of combinational
perturbation of 2 Sgenes could be calcualted.The kinases of double perturbation
with higher WIGs could be the candidate combinational therapeutic targets.
```{r}
Sgene_double_WIG<-WIG_double(EMT_post,15)
